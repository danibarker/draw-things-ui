				Welcome to the AI Art Generator! This is a tool that uses OpenAI's
				DALL-E model to generate images based on text prompts.
			</p>
			<p>
				To get started, enter a prompt in the text box at the top of the page.
				This can be anything you want, such as "a cat made of pizza" or "a city
				on the moon." You can also adjust the settings to change the appearance
				of the generated images.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you've entered a prompt and adjusted the settings, click the
				"Generate" button to create an image. You can generate multiple images
				at once by clicking the "Generate" button multiple times.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can view the images you've generated in the gallery on the right
				side of the page. Click on an image to view it in full size.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also view the queue of images that are waiting to be generated
				by clicking the "Queue" button in the top right corner of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's it! Have fun creating your own AI-generated art, and feel free to
				reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

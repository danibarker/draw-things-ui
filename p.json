	"text": "Once upon a time, in a described place somewhere, there was a group of something that had discovered something: something. It all started when a something accidentally left behind something with something. A young one with a name was the first to do something with it, and the sensation was describable.\nWord spread through the community about this, a describable trait, with just the right hint of another trait. Soon, every one in the place was doing something with something. They'd close their eyes and imagine that their usual something was like the other thing.\nOne day, the wisest thing, an old something, hatched a plan. They'd do \"something\" from somewhere.\nThey did something for one trait, something else for another trait, and did something else for a third trait. When they were done, they had a \"something\" that looked nothing like the real one but had all the love they could muster.\n\nThat night, under the stars, they gathered around and did the thing with the thing, and though it didn't have the traits of the thing, they swore they could sense a thing about it.\n\nFrom then on, each thing's birthday was celebrated with a something -- imaginary, but something describable all the same. And in their place, something became a cherished tradition.",
